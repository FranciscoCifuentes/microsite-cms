## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Microsite CMS seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository owner (check GitHub profile)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: We'll evaluate the severity and impact
3. **Fix**: We'll work on a fix if confirmed
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Measures

### Implemented Security Controls

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - NextAuth for secure authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - JWT-based sessions
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

2. **Input Validation**
   - Zod schema validation on all API inputs
   - File type and size validation
   - MIME type verification

3. **Content Security**
   - Markdown sanitization with rehype-sanitize
   - No HTML/JavaScript injection allowed
   - XSS prevention through output encoding

4. **Data Protection**
   - Tenant isolation at database level
   - Prepared statements via Prisma (SQL injection prevention)
   - Environment variable protection

5. **File Upload Security**
   - File type whitelist
   - Size limits (10MB default)
   - Antivirus scanning hooks
   - Secure file storage with tenant scoping

6. **API Security**
   - Authentication required on protected endpoints
   - Tenant validation on all data access
   - Rate limiting ready (to be configured)
   - CORS protection

### Recommended Production Settings

When deploying to production, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="long-random-string-min-32-chars"
   NODE_ENV="production"
   ANTIVIRUS_ENABLED="true"
   ```

2. **Security Headers** (configure in your hosting platform)
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
   ```

3. **Database**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Enable SSL/TLS for connections
   - Restrict network access
   - Regular automated backups

4. **Storage**
   - Use private S3 buckets
   - Enable versioning
   - Configure bucket policies
   - Enable access logging

5. **Monitoring**
   - Enable error logging
   - Set up security alerts
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track API usage patterns

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Not enforced by default
   - Recommendation: Configure rate limiting at infrastructure level
   - Consider using services like Cloudflare or AWS WAF

2. **Antivirus Scanning**: Hook implemented but requires external service
   - Recommendation: Deploy ClamAV or similar
   - Configure ANTIVIRUS_HOST and enable scanning

3. **2FA**: Not currently implemented
   - Planned for future release
   - Use strong passwords in the meantime

4. **Password Policies**: Basic implementation
   - Recommendation: Enforce strong password requirements
   - Consider password strength meter

### Areas of Responsibility

**Application Security** (Our responsibility):
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Authentication logic
- Authorization checks
- Secure defaults

**Infrastructure Security** (Deployment responsibility):
- TLS/SSL certificates
- Firewall configuration
- DDoS protection
- Rate limiting
- Backup encryption

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use .env files (not committed)
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Use secret management tools

2. **Always validate input**
   - Use Zod schemas
   - Validate on server-side
   - Don't trust client data

3. **Check permissions**
   - Verify authentication
   - Check user roles
   - Validate tenant access

4. **Sanitize output**
   - Use markdown renderer
   - Escape HTML entities
   - Prevent XSS attacks

5. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

### For Administrators

1. **Use strong passwords**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - Unique per user

2. **Limit user permissions**
   - Grant minimum required access
   - Use Viewer role when possible
   - Audit user access regularly

3. **Monitor logs**
   - Check for suspicious activity
   - Review failed login attempts
   - Monitor API usage patterns

4. **Keep system updated**
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Update dependencies regularly
   - Test updates in staging first

5. **Backup regularly**
   - Automated daily backups
   - Test restore procedures
   - Store backups securely

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve logs and evidence
   - Change compromised credentials
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify entry point
   - Assess data exposure
   - Document findings

3. **Remediation**
   - Apply security patches
   - Close vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups if needed
   - Update security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Review incident timeline
   - Update security procedures
   - Improve monitoring
   - Train team on lessons learned

## Compliance

This application is designed to support:

- **GDPR**: Data privacy and user rights
- **HIPAA**: Health sector data protection (when configured properly)
- **OWASP Top 10**: Common web security risks

**Note**: Compliance requires proper deployment and configuration. Consult with legal/compliance teams for your specific requirements.
